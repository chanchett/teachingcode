   PROGRAMMING!
   ------------
   These lessons are going to be teaching you programming. I'll try not to focus too much on things specific
   to a certain programming language and instead focus on general programming concepts and how to make the
   computer do stuff, which is the important part.


   COMPILING AND RUNNING
   ---------------------
   So how do we make the computer do stuff? The computer runs what's called "machine code", and giving the computer
   instructions in machine code would certainly make it do stuff, but machine code is code for machines,
   unsurprisingly, and hard to read for humans.
   We want to write in something readable (a human code, perhaps?), which is where languages like C and C++ come in.
   These languages are (relatively) understandable to humans, and we can use a compiler to take the C or C++ code
   and compile it into machine code, which the computer runs.

   This file itself is code (which is why it has the slashes and junk). From the command line, type in "compile.bat lesson1.cpp"
   without the quotation marks and press enter.
   It should display this:



Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.00.23026 for x86

lesson1.cpp
Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 14.00.23026.0

/out:lesson1.exe
lesson1.obj



   You have now compiled a program!!!


   Now type "compiled_programs\lesson1.exe" and press enter.
   It should display "I am a computer, beep boop."


   First lesson done! Onto lesson2.cpp!














   (BTW, ignore this.)
