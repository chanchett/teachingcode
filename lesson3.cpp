int main()
{
  // VARIABLES AND INTEGERS
  // So the computer is gonna the commands inside the curly braces after main. So what do we tell it?
  // Computers like numbers, so let's start with those.
  
  integer five=5;

  // This tells the compiler to store an "integer", call it "five", and set it equal to 5.
  // So, what's an integer? An integer is just a number with nothing after the decimal point, like
  // 1 or 113, as opposed to 0.5 or 7.7, which aren't integers.

  integer another_variable=five;

  // We can use variables we've already assigned to define other variables, so "another_variable" now has a value of 5.
  // Okay, cool, but why do we care? Well, we care because we can do operations on variables to give us results.
  // In particular, we can do math.

  integer ten=five+five;         // Addition
  integer zero=five-five;        // Subtraction
  integer twenty_five=five*five; // Multiplication
  integer one=five/five;         // Division
